Random bugs
-----------

### Wireless

The dhcpcd client doesn't work for this laptop.  Use dhclient instead.

Turns out that the reason why wireless isn't working (aftering switching to
dhclient) is because the wireless CAN be turned on and off with the switch on
your keyboard!

### Authorization Manager failure

Had a problem with Authorization Manager (polkit) failed to start at boot.
Fixed by simply reinstalling it with pacman.

### Flash drive not detected

Turns out it's because the linux kernel that's installed and the kernel that's
running are of different versions.  Just reboot.

Force `su` to prompt for password
---------------------------------

If you want `su` to prompt for password, *comment out* this line:

    #auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
