Misc bugs
---------

Turns out that the reason why wireless isn't working (aftering switching to
dhclient) is because the wireless CAN be turned on and off with the switch on
your keyboard!

Had a problem with Authorization Manager (polkit) failed to start at boot.
Fixed by simply reinstalling it with pacman.

Force `su` to prompt for password
---------------------------------

If you want `su` to prompt for password, *comment out* this line:

    #auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
