Rufflewind/config
=================

A collection of scripts, utilities, and configuration files for my Unix-like systems.

- Scripts and utilities are mostly found in [`home/sbin`](home/sbin), [`root/bin`](root/bin), and the sibling repository [`devutils`](https://github.com/Rufflewind/devutils).
- Configuration files are scattered all over [`home`](home) and [`root`](root).

Many of the configuration files in `root` are intended for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) and may have modified slightly for other operating systems.
