Rufflewind/config
=================

A collection of scripts, utilties, and configuration files used on my
Unix-like systems.  Some of it is specific to Arch Linux, although much of it
can be adapted for other distributions and operating systems with a little
effort.

A collection of scripts can be found in [home/sbin](home/sbin) as well as the
sibling repository of various
[development tools](https://github.com/Rufflewind/devutils).
